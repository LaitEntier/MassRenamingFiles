# MassRenamingFiles
A Visual Basic script I made a while ago, used to mass rename files with similar names, like photos. 
Only useful if you're a storage freak like me and want to keep your folders organized.

Symply drop the file in the folder where you want to rename, run it and follow the prompts.
